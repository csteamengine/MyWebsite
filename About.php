    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Gregory Steenhagen and I am a software engineering major at Iowa State University. I grew up just 15 minutes
    south of Ames in Roland. I graduated from Roland-Story high school where I participated in football, basketball, track, and baseball
    all four years. I was in band, chorus, jazz band, and the musicals all four years as well. Being so busy with extra curricular activities,
    I didn't have time to realize I was a computer nerd. I was always interested in computers, but it took until college for me to
    figure out what I wanted to do with me life. I have always been an ISU fan and I always knew I wanted to go there so that choice was easy for me.
    </p>
    <p>I started college as a Mechanical Engineering major and quickly decided to switch to software, after I realized computers
    were what I truly enjoyed working with. After switching, a friend and I started the Web Development Club at ISU of which I am
    the Vice President and Treasurer. </p>
